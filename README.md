# loan_lending
Loan lending is a profitable and viable business which most investors have invested a lot of their money in and returned hundsome interests. Loans are advanced for a number of reasons including major purchases, investing, renovations, debt consolidation, and business ventures. The interest and fees from loans are primary source of revenue for many banks and some retailers through the use of credit facilities and credit card. However, the success of a loan company is highly dependent on wether a client will default or not. Therefore, it is important to have prior knowledge as to whether the client likely to default or not. Due this, it was found to be important to develop a prediction model that utilises deep learning to detect wether a client will default or not. In this project, using the historical data from 2007 to 2015 of a company called Lending club, a deep learning model was built to predict the chance of default for future loans.
